The **BNB Automation Tool** is a powerful utility designed for the BNB Chain Mainnet. It connects to other blockchains using cross-network bridges, enabling seamless asset movement and unlocking new opportunities. The tool monitors network activity, identifies valuable moments, and executes precise actions to benefit from market changes.

It integrates with decentralized platforms like PancakeSwap, BakerySwap, and ApeSwap, performing fast operations with BEP-20 tokens for efficiency. Additionally, it supports cross-network strategies by leveraging price differences across blockchains via bridges.

## Key Features

- **Run Locally**: Operate the tool on your machine, independent of external servers. Install dependencies and launch it yourself.  
- **Telegram Alerts**: Get instant notifications about actions, staking updates, and performance reports in your Telegram chat.  
- **Staking Support**: Lock BNB with validators directly through the tool to earn passive rewards.  

The tool provides an easy-to-use console interface with QR code generation for wallet funding. A minimum balance of **0.5 BNB** is required to cover network fees and initial operations. It’s an excellent solution for users looking to streamline advanced DeFi tasks on the BNB Chain.
