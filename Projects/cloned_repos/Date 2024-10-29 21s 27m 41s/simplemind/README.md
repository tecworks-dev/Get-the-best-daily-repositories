## Quickstart

SimpleMind takes care of the complex API calls so you can focus on what matters—building, experimenting, and creating.

First, authenticate your API keys by setting them in the environment variables:

```bash
$ export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

This pattern allows you to keep your API keys private and out of your codebase. Other supported environment variables: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `XAI_API_KEY`, and `GROQ_API_KEY`.

Next, import SimpleMind and start using it:

```python
import simplemind as sm
```


## Examples

Here are some examples of how to use SimpleMind:

### Text Completion

Generate a response from an AI model based on a given prompt:

```pycon
>>> sm.generate_text(prompt="What is the meaning of life?", llm_provider="openai", llm_model="gpt-4o")
"The meaning of life is a profound philosophical question that has been explored by cultures, religions, and philosophers for centuries. Different people and belief systems offer varying interpretations:\n\n1. **Religious Perspectives:** Many religions propose that the meaning of life is to fulfill a divine purpose, serve God, or reach an afterlife. For example, Christianity often emphasizes love, faith, and service to God and others as central to life’s meaning.\n\n2. **Philosophical Views:** Philosophers offer diverse answers. Existentialists like Jean-Paul Sartre argue that life has no inherent meaning, and it is up to individuals to create their own purpose. Others, like Aristotle, suggest that achieving eudaimonia (flourishing or happiness) through virtuous living is the key to a meaningful life.\n\n3. **Scientific and Secular Approaches:** Some people find meaning through understanding the natural world, contributing to human knowledge, or through personal accomplishments and happiness. They may view life's meaning as a product of connection, legacy, or the pursuit of knowledge and creativity.\n\n4. **Personal Perspective:** For many, the meaning of life is deeply personal, involving their relationships, passions, and goals. These individuals define life's purpose through experiences, connections, and the impact they have on others and the world.\n\nUltimately, the meaning of life is a subjective question, with each person finding their own answers based on their beliefs, experiences, and reflections."
```

### Structured Data with Pydantic

You can use Pydantic models to structure the response from the LLM, if the LLM supports it.

```python
class Poem(BaseModel):
    title: str
    content: str
```

```pycon
>>> sm.generate_data(
        "Write a poem about love",
        llm_model="gpt-4o-mini",
        llm_provider="openai",
        response_model=Poem,
    )
title='Eternal Embrace' content='In the quiet hours of the night,\nWhen stars whisper secrets bright,\nTwo hearts beat in a gentle rhyme,\nDancing through the sands of time.\n\nWith every glance, a spark ignites,\nA flame that warms the coldest nights,\nIn laughter shared and whispers sweet,\nLove paints the world, a masterpiece.\n\nThrough stormy skies and sunlit days,\nIn myriad forms, it finds its ways,\nA tender touch, a knowing sigh,\nIn love’s embrace, we learn to fly.\n\nAs seasons change and moments fade,\nIn the tapestry of dreams we’ve laid,\nLove’s threads endure, forever bind,\nA timeless bond, two souls aligned.\n\nSo here’s to love, both bright and true,\nA gift we give, anew, anew,\nIn every heartbeat, every prayer,\nA story written in the air.'
```

### Conversational AI

SimpleMind also allows for easy conversational flows:

```pycon
>>> conversation = sm.create_conversation(llm_model="gpt-4o-mini", llm_provider="openai")

>>> # Add a message to the conversation
>>> conversation.add_message("user", "Hi there, how are you?")

>>> conversation.send()
<Message role=assistant text="Hello! I'm just a computer program, so I don't have feelings, but I'm here and ready to help you. How can I assist you today?">
```

To continue the conversation, you can call `conversation.send()` again, which returns the next message in the conversation:

```pycon
>>> conversation.add_message("user", "What is the meaning of life?")
>>> conversation.send()
<Message role=assistant text="The meaning of life is a profound philosophical question that has been explored by cultures, religions, and philosophers for centuries. Different people and belief systems offer varying interpretations:\n\n1. **Religious Perspectives:** Many religions propose that the meaning of life is to fulfill a divine purpose, serve God, or reach an afterlife. For example, Christianity often emphasizes love, faith, and service to God and others as central to life’s meaning.\n\n2. **Philosophical Views:** Philosophers offer diverse answers. Existentialists like Jean-Paul Sartre argue that life has no inherent meaning, and it is up to individuals to create their own purpose.

They may view life’s meaning as a product of connection, legacy, or the pursuit of knowledge and creativity.\n\n4. **Personal Perspective:** For many, the meaning of life is deeply personal, involving their relationships, passions, and goals. These individuals define life’s purpose through experiences, connections, and the impact they have on others and the world.\n\nUltimately, the meaning of life is a subjective question, with each person finding their own answers based on their beliefs, experiences, and reflections.">

### Basic Memory Plugin

Harnessing the power of Python, you can easily create your own plugins to add additional functionality to your conversations:

```python
import simplemind as sm


class SimpleMemoryPlugin:
    def __init__(self):
        self.memories = [
            "the earth has fictionally beeen destroyed.",
            "the moon is made of cheese.",
        ]

    def yield_memories(self):
        return (m for m in self.memories)

    def send_hook(self, conversation: sm.Conversation):
        for m in self.yield_memories():
            conversation.add_message(role="system", text=m)


conversation = sm.create_conversation(llm_model="grok-beta", llm_provider="xai")
conversation.add_plugin(SimpleMemoryPlugin())


conversation.add_message(
    role="user",
    text="Please write a poem about the moon",
)
```
```pycon
>>> conversation.send()
In the vast expanse where stars do play,
There orbits a cheese wheel, far away.
It's not of stone or silver hue,
But cheddar's glow, a sight anew.

In cosmic silence, it does roam,
A lonely traveler, away from home.
No longer does it reflect the sun,
But now it's known for fun begun.

Once Earth's companion, now alone,
A cheese moon orbits, in the dark it's thrown.
Its surface, not of craters wide,
But gouda, swiss, and camembert's pride.

Astronauts of yore, they sought its face,
To find the moon was not a place,
But a haven of dairy delight,
Glowing softly through the night.

In this world, where cheese takes flight,
The moon brings laughter, a whimsical sight.
No longer just a silent sphere,
But a beacon of joy, far and near.

So here's to the moon, in cheese attire,
A playful twist in the cosmic choir.
A reminder that in tales and fun,
The universe is never done.
```
