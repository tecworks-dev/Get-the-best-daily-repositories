            caption: "STRING",
            cta: "STRING"

## Project Demo
Path: [Demo/Demo.xcodeproj](https://github.com/1998code/19-Splash-Screen-for-SwiftUI/tree/main/Demo)

## Known Issues
**Major**
- Gesture is **disabled** due to multiple bugs
  - Dragging (from left to right) is not working due to offset; and
  - Dragging (from right to left) works but fails the ```currentIndex```
- Only compatible with iOS18+, like Apple Invites app
- Only tested on iPhone 16 Pro/Pro Max (Resize problem on small devices)
- Possible memory leakage when inserting too many items into the array

**Minor**
- The auto-rotation+paging feels like a "Conveyor belt sushi 🍣", not so smooth.
