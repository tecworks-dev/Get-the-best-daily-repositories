        Initializes the WSPipe with necessary parameters for configuring an eclipsepipe that interacts with a specified
        search mechanism and handles websocket connections.

        Args:
            search_name: The name of the search mechanism or service that the WSPipe will utilize. This name is used
                to identify the search functionality within the broader system.
            eclipse_pipe: An instance of EclipsePipe that facilitates communication between the agent, engine and other
                components of the system. This pipe is crucial for data transfer and message handling within the
                agent's operational context.
            ws_handler: An optional callable that handles websocket connections. It takes a `ServerConnection`
                instance as an argument and returns an awaitable that processes incoming messages or events.
                If not provided, the WSPipe may use a default websocket handler.
            host: The hostname or IP address of the websocket server where the eclipsepipe will be running.
                This parameter is important for establishing connections. Defaults to None, in which case the WSPipe
                may use a predefined host or local address.
            port: The port number on which the WSPipe will listen for incoming connections. This is crucial for network
                communication. Defaults to None, indicating that the WSPipe may use a standard port or a configured
                setting.
            kwargs: Additional keyword arguments that may be required for further customization or to pass additional
                configuration websocket server.
