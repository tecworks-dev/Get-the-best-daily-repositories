        Initializes the IOPipe with necessary parameters for configuring an eclipsepipe that interacts with a specified
        search mechanism and handles websocket connections.

        Args:
            search_name: The name of the search mechanism or service that the IOPipe will utilize. This name is used
                to identify the search functionality within the broader system.
            eclipse_pipe: An instance of EclipsePipe that facilitates communication between the agent, engine and other
                components of the system. This pipe is crucial for data transfer and message handling within the
                agent's operational context.
            read_prompt: An optional prompt string used for guiding the reading information.
                This prompt can help shape the queries made during the search operation. Defaults to None
                if not provided.
            write_prompt: An optional prompt string used for guiding the writing of information.
                This prompt may assist in structuring the responses or data being sent. Defaults to None
                if not provided.
